# Reportbyte

This Information system is built for academic purpose from the perspective of 
improving the report generator for student examination result as a platform for 
teacher-student interaction made in a classroom setting. The software we built we 
call it as ReportByte.
The Process begins as the teachers input the marks to the system, and the system 
generates the result in the result sheet automatically for each student and 
thereafter the teacher can print the result sheets and share it with the students. 
Student teacher interaction is often needed though in order to provide an efficient 
service minimizing human errors in calculations of marks, providing the results. 
This system helps the teacher to overcome the challenge they face enabling them 
to provide the best way to generate result sheets. 
The software we built is identified using SAD module using .NET framework 
developed for desktop built supporting cross-platform windows desktop application 
with using C# language along with the CRUD operations such as Create, Update 
& Delete functions. The IDE which has been used to develop the system is Visual 
Studio 2020 newest version and C# is a language which is productive, multi purpose and type-safe, object oriented and open source therefore designing this 
application run on .NET framework in Visual Studio provides with a rich code 
analysis for APIâ€™s along with the .NET complier helps to edit and debug with live 
assistance. 
The Databased used for the system is SQL Database and has been connected 
using SQL commands where the data can be retrieved, Update and Delete anytime 
without any issues. 
The system can be implemented further with more evaluation of teacher-student 
aspect.
